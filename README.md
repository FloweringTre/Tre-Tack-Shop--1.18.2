# Tre's Tack Shop 
An addon mod to SWEM that expands the number of tack items in the game for the community to use to add new textures to the game without overriding the original tack items. It also includes ribbons and trophy models from the original SWEM mod in order to produce ribbons and trophies that can be displayed as the creators intended them to be but now in an item frame instead of a placeable block, thus keeping the name/NBT data of the item. 

*All items only be obtainable in the creative menu / give commands, there are no recipes in this mod.* Basically, a little add-on mod that acts like a custom tack shop for players and servers to use to gain custom tack based on their resource packs. 

Also include new models of my own design as I make them. -- currently added a cute pumpkin trophy

All rendered (appearing on the SWEM horses) 'Rainbow' Tack items are textures made by Moon Flower. [Click here to see her links](https://moon-flower-info.carrd.co/ 'Moon Flower's Carrd)

### Note to resources pack makers
All tack items have two textures attached to them, the texture on the horse and the icon in the menus/inventory. To change rendered horse textures, you must replace the numbered .png file in the ***swem*** assets folder. To change the icon textures, you must replace the numbered .png file in the ***tretackshop*** assets folder.

**A template texture pack that includes instructions in a read-me file along with all of this mod's template textures is shared in our discord**
