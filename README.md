# Tre's Tack Shop
An addon mod to SWEM that expands the number of tack items in the game for the community to use to add new textures to the game without overriding the original tack items. It also includes ribbons and trophy models from the original SWEM mod in order to produce ribbons and trophies that can be displayed as the creators intended them to be but now in an item frame instead of a placeable block, thus keeping the name/NBT data of the item.

***Over 1,000 new tack items added!***

### *Now featuring crafting recipes!*
This mod started as just a place for resource artists to stash new textures on; but now it includes fully rendered and designed tack in all types including some new ones! It also now includes survival crafting recipes for those items as a 'Tack Set' and also has an uncraftable 'Award Set' so servers can have custom tack items for their server that are uncraftable by players.

Also include new models of my own design as I make them. -- currently added a cute pumpkin trophy, drill team flags, and 'wearable' medals! Also includes models that Moon Flower makes such as the Snowflake trophy, the bitless/bareback tack and the quarter sheets!

### Thank you to our helpers!

### Note to resources pack makers
All tack items have two textures attached to them, the texture on the horse and the icon in the menus/inventory. To change rendered horse textures, you must replace the numbered .png file in the ***swem*** assets folder. To change the icon textures, you must replace the numbered .png file in the ***tretackshop*** assets folder.

**A template texture pack that includes instructions in a read-me file along with all of this mod's template textures is shared in our discord**
